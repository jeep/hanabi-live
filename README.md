## Description

* This is the source code for my [Hanabi game server](http://hanabi.live/).
* This is an emulation of the [Keldon Hanabi game server](http://keldon.net/hanabi/), of which the source code is not published.
* It is programmed in [Go](https://golang.org/).
* It uses a [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) database to store information about the users and games.
* All database logic is in the `src/models` subdirectory.
* The client-side JavaScript is located in `public/js`.

## Credits

* [Keldon Jones](http://keldon.net/) was the original creator of game UI.
* [Hyphen-ated](https://github.com/Hyphen-ated/) created the useful Chrome extension called [Make Hanabi Great Again](https://github.com/Hyphen-ated/MakeHanabiGreatAgain), which extended the features of the original site. The features from the extension are integrated into the new site.
